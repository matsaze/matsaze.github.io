          <p>
            <span class="strength">He was unbelievably strong, absolutely inexhaustible, amazingly agile and basically unbreakable.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            His hair was straight. His long beard was arranged in double braids. His very long mustache was neatly combed. His very long hair was tied in a pony tail. He had a very broad chin. He had a scratchy voice. His somewhat splayed out,  narrow ears were very short. His nose was slightly hooked. His hair was gold. His skin was pale pink. His eyes were emerald. His eyes were somewhat narrow. His nose bridge was slightly convex.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="strength">He had a stunning feel for spatial relationships, unbreakable focus, uncanny intuition, an unbreakable will, a great kinesthetic sense, a great deal of patience and a good memory,</span> <span class="weakness">but he had little natural inclination toward music.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            He always acted with mercy and compassion at the forefront of his considerations, <span class="trauma">a strengthening after seeing the goblin Suque Ismanpim die in 252,</span> and he was conflicted by this since he saw these tendencies as an impediment to the quest for power. He sought out exciting and adventurous situations. He tended to be a bit stubborn in changing his mind about things. He tended to form only tenuous emotional bonds with others. He rarely felt discouraged. He took offered help and gifts without feeling particularly grateful. He had a greedy streak. He tended to be swayed by the emotions of others. He had a sense of duty. He had an active imagination. He tended to assume the worst of two outcomes would be the one that came to pass. He could easily fall in love or develop positive sentiments.
          </p>

					<p>
            <span class="quirk">He inhaled sharply when he was angry. He spoke very deliberately when he was angry. He often greeted others with a hug.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            He needed alcohol to get through the working day. He did not mind being outdoors, at least for a time. He didn't really care about anything anymore.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like others in his culture, he held craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrated talented artisans and their masterworks, had a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prized loyalty, valued family greatly, saw friendship as one of the finer things in life, believed that honesty was a high ideal, greatly respected artists and their works, really respected those that took the time to master a skill, deeply respected those that worked hard at their labors, valued cooperation, found merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, valued martial prowess, valued leisure time, respected commerce, valued knowledge and found nature somewhat disturbing. <span class="values">He personally believed that the acquisition of power over others is the ideal goal in life and worthy of the highest respect</span> <span class="trauma">(due to experiencing trauma in 254)</span> <span class="values">and found the idea of fair-dealing foolish and cheated when he found it profitable.</span> <span class="dream">He dreamt of raising a family.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            He liked limonite, lead, rock crystal, basking shark leather, sea lamprey tooth, anchovy bone, the color pale pink, maces, scepters, alpacas for their long necks, nightmares for their unfathomably horrifying nature, white millet plants for their grain, the words of The Festive Wisdom and the sound of The Plays of Aquamarine. When possible, he preferred to consume giant kingsnake, banana beer, llama's milk and paradise nut fruits. He absolutely detested purring maggots.
