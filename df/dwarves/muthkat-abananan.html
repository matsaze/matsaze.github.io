            <span class="weakness">He was susceptible to disease.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            His very long beard was arranged in double braids. His sideburns were clean-shaven. His very long mustache was arranged in double braids. His very long hair was neatly combed. His very short ears were very splayed out. His gold eyes were incredibly close-set. He had a scratchy voice. His nose was quite long. His teeth were crowded. His nose bridge was slightly convex. His hair was saffron. His skin was pink.

          <p>
            <span class="strength">He had a great feel for the surrounding space and a good intellect,</span> <span class="weakness">but he had poor empathy, little linguistic ability and little patience.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            He could be very happy and optimistic, <span class="trauma">a turn-around after becoming a parent in 255.</span> He lived a fast-paced life. He generally found himself quite hopeful about the future. He did not have a great aesthetic sensitivity, and he was conflicted by this as he valued artwork and its creation. He was stubborn. He had a sense of duty. He had a tendency to consider ideas and abstractions over practical applications. He was rarely happy or enthusiastic, and he was conflicted by this as he valued parties and merrymaking in the abstract. He generally acted with a narrow focus on the current activity. He was somewhat uncomfortable around those that appeared unusual or lived differently from himself. He didn't mind wearing something special now and again. He had a greedy streak. He was not particularly interested in what others thought of him. He tended to think before acting. He tended to be passive in discussions.
          </p>

					<p>
            He needed alcohol to get through the working day. He did not mind being outdoors, at least for a time. He didn't really care about anything anymore.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like others in his culture, he held craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrated talented artisans and their masterworks, had a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prized loyalty, valued family greatly, saw friendship as one of the finer things in life, believed that honesty was a high ideal, greatly respected artists and their works, really respected those that took the time to master a skill, deeply respected those that worked hard at their labors, respected fair dealing and fair-play, valued cooperation, found merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, valued martial prowess, valued leisure time, respected commerce, valued knowledge and found nature somewhat disturbing. <span class="values">He personally was affronted by the whole notion of maintaining decorum and found so-called dignified people disgusting</span> <span class="trauma">(due to retching on a miasma in 255),</span> <span class="values">saw freedom and independence as completely worthless, valued peace over war</span> <span class="trauma">(due to becoming a parent in 255),</span> <span class="values">and valued romance.</span> <span class="dream">He dreamt of raising a family, and that dream was realized.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            He liked dacite, silver, aquamarine, gems, doors, rings, animal traps and the sound of The Dessert of Flutes. When possible, he preferred to consume chicory and spelt beer. He absolutely detested blood gnats.
