            <span class="strength">She was incredibly tough and quick to heal.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            Her very long hair was tied in a pony tail. Her nose was incredibly upturned. She had a grating, raspy voice. Her heliotrope eyes were protruding. Her small-lobed, narrow ears were very short. Her eyebrows were extremely sparse. Her head was somewhat tall. Her hair was gray with a touch of ochre. Her skin was dark peach.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="strength">She had a lot of willpower and the ability to focus,</span> <span class="weakness">but she had an iffy sense for music and poor analytical abilities.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            She was swayed by emotional appeals. She was given to flights of fancy to the point of distraction. She was greatly pleased by her own looks and accomplishments. She didn't mind a little tumult and discord in day-to-day living. She was grateful when others helped her out and tried to return favors. She liked to take it easy. She was somewhat fearful in the face of imminent danger. She often felt discouraged. She generally acted with a narrow focus on the current activity. She tried to keep her things orderly. She was not particularly interested in what others thought of her.
          </p>

					<p>
            <span class="quirk">Her hands were animated when she spoke.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            She needed alcohol to get through the working day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like others in her culture, she held craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrated talented artisans and their masterworks, had a great deal of respect for the law, saw friendship as one of the finer things in life, believed that honesty was a high ideal, really respected those that took their time to master a skill, deeply respected those that worked hard at their labors, found merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, valued martial prowess, valued leisure time, respected commerce, valued cooperation, valued knowledge, respected fair-dealing and fair-play and found nature somewhat disturbing. <span class="values">She personally valued artwork, didn't particularly value loyalty, didn't care about nature one way or another</span> <span class="trauma">(less extreme after being caught in a snow storm in 256)</span> <span class="values">and did not care about family one way or the other.</span> <span class="dream">She dreamt of crafting a masterwork someday.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            She liked pitchblende, copper, sapphire, giant mole leather, the words of The Festive Wisdom, the sound of The Earth of Gravel and the sight of The Sparkle of Cherishing. When possible, she preferred to consume passion fruit wine. She absolutely detested brown recluse spiders.
