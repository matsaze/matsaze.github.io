          <p>
            <span class="strength">He was very slow to tire, quite quick to heal, tough and agile.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            His medium-length beard was braided. His very long sideburns were braided. His medium-length mustache was arranged in double braids. His very long hair was tied in a pony tail. His teeth were crowded. He had a scratchy voice. His nose was quite long. His head was somewhat short. His cinnamon skin was wrinkled. His ears had small lobes. His hair was amber with a touch of gray. His eyes were emerald.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="strength">He had an iron will and very good intuition,</span> <span class="weakness">but he had an iffy sense for music, poor creativity and really poor focus.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            He was ruled by irresistible cravings and urges. He never deliberated before acting, to the point of being considered thoughtless. He was very quick to anger. He tended to be swayed by the emotions of others. He had an active sense of humor. He tended to be a bit stubborn in changing his mind about things. He wasn't given to flights of fancy. He generally acted with a narrow focus on the current activity. He was trusting.
          </p>

					<p>
            <span class="quirk">When he was nervous, he often interrupted others during conversations.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            He needed alcohol to get through the working day. He liked working outdoors and grumbled only mildly at inclement weather. He didn't really care about anything anymore.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like others in his culture, he held craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrated talented artisans and their masterworks, had a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prized loyalty, valued family greatly, saw friendship as one of the finer things in life, believed that honesty was a high ideal, greatly respected artists and their works, really respected those that took their time to master a skill, deeply respected those that worked hard at their labors, respected fair-dealing and fair-play, valued cooperation, valued martial prowess, valued leisure time, respected commerce, valued knowledge and found nature somewhat disturbing. <span class="values">He personally truly valued merrymaking and parties and respected perseverance</span> <span class="trauma">(due to not having a tomb after gaining another year in 252).</span> <span class="dream">He dreamt of raising a family.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            He liked bituminous coal, nickel silver, chrysoberyl, bitter orange wood wood, oyster shell, the color crimson, gems, figurines, yaks for their shaggy hair, snail men for their shells, the words of The Playful Bird and the sight of the Sparkle of Cherishing. When possible, he preferred to consume kea, nautilus and pomegranate wine. He absolutely detested cave spiders.
