        <div class="description">
          <p>
            <span class="strength">She was absolutely inexhaustible, unbelievably strong, incredibly tough and almost never sick.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            Her hair was straight. Her very long hair was tied in a pony tail. She had a grating, raspy voice. Her amethyst eyes were close-set. Her ears were very short. Her head was somewhat short. Her nose was slightly hooked. Her dark peach skin was slightly wrinkled. Her hair was auburn with a touch of gray.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="strength">She had unbreakable focus, uncanny intuition, an astounding feel for the position of her own body, a stunning feel for spatial relationships, a great feel for social relationships, an iron will, a deep well of patience and a way with words,</span> <span class="weakness">but she had very bad analytical abilities and a poor memory.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            She was in a constant state of internal rage. She was often sad and dejected, <span class="trauma">after experiencing trauma in 252.</span> She occasionally overindulged. She was rarely happy or enthusiastic, and she was conflicted by this as she valued parties and merrymaking in the abstract. She generally acted impartially and was rarely moved to mercy, and she was disturbed by this as someone who disliked those that sought to acquire power over others. She wasn't particularly ambitious. She was not particularly interested in what others thought of her. She tended to be a little wasteful when working on projects. She liked a little excitement now and then. She liked to brawl.
          </p>

					<p>
            <span class="quirk">She often greeted others with a hug.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            She needed alcohol to get through the working day. She did not mind being outdoors, at least for a time. She didn't really care about anything anymore.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like others in her culture, she held craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrated talented artisans and their masterworks, greatly prized loyalty, valued family greatly, saw friendship as one of the finer things in life, believed that honesty was a high ideal, greatly respected artists and their works, really respected those that took their time to master a skill, deeply respected those that worked hard at their labors, respected fair-dealing and fair-play, valued cooperation, found merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, valued martial prowess, valued leisure time, respected commerce, valued knowledge and found nature somewhat disturbing. <span class="values">She personally would have had the world operate in complete harmony without the least bit of strife or disorder</span> <span class="trauma">(due to experiencing trauma in 256),</span> <span class="values">hated those who wielded power over others</span> <span class="trauma">(due to experiencing trauma in 252),</span> <span class="values">valued sacrifice</span> <span class="trauma">(due to experiencing trauma in 254),</span> <span class="values">found maintaining decorum a silly, fumbling waste of time</span> <span class="trauma">(due to being caught in a snow storm in 250),</span> <span class="values">did not respect the law and found those that deny their impulses somewhat stiff.</span> <span class="dream">She dreamt of crafting a great work of art.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            She liked tin glaze, gold, fire agate, giant snail shell, the color pale pink, maces, bucklers and brown recluse spiders for their venomous bite. When possible, she preferred to consume cave lobster, cave fish and date wine. She absolutely detested toads.
