          <p>
            His very long beard was arranged in double braids. His sideburns were clean-shaven. His very long mustache was arranged in double braids. His long hair was tied in a pony tail. He had a scratchy voice. His somewhat narrow, rust eyes were close-set. His hair was buff with flecks of gray. His skin was brown.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="strength">He had good creativity,</span> <span class="weakness">but he had a shortage of patience and a very bad sense of empathy.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            He sought out exciting and adventurous situations. He could sometimes act without deliberation. He was somewhat quarrelsome, and he was bothered by this since he valued friendship. He preferred to present himself modestly. He sometimes acted with little determination and confidence. He often felt envious of others. He generally acted with a narrow focus on the current activity. He had an active sense of humor. He tended to be a bit stubborn in changing his mind about things.

					<p>
            <span class="quirk">He kept his voice very quiet when he was nervous. He winked during conversations.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            He needed alcohol to get through the working day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like others in his culture, he held craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrated talented artisans and their masterworks, had a great deal of respect for the law, greatly prized loyalty, valued family greatly, saw friendship as one of the finer things in life, believed that honesty was a high ideal, greatly respected artists and their works, really respected those that took the time to master a skill, deeply respected those that worked hard at their labors, respected fair-dealing and fair-play, valued cooperation, found merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, valued martial prowess, valued leisure time, respected commerce, valued knowledge and found nature somewhat disturbing. <span class="values">He personally saw concealment of emotions as a betrayal and tried his best never to associate with such secretive fools</span> <span class="trauma">(due to being caught in a snow storm in 256).</span> <span class="values">He personally thought romance was very important in life, respected power and found maintaining decorum a silly, fumbling waste of time.</span> <span class="dream">He dreamt of falling in love.</span>
          </p>

          <p>
            He liked porcelain, trifle pewter, green tourmaline, shields, goblets, the words of The Sweetness of Scholars, the sound of The Plays of Aquamarine and the sight of The Sparkle of Cherishing. When possible, he preferred to consume giant rattlesnake, cave lobster and passion fruit wine. He absolutely detested worms.
