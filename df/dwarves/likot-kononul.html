            <span class="weakness">He was flimsy and clumsy.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            He had high cheekbones. He had a scratchy voice. His long beard was braided. His very long sideburns were braided. His long mustache was neatly combed. His hair was clean-shaven. His teeth were crowded. His ears were narrow. His nose was slightly hooked. His hair was dark tan. His skin was copper. His eyes were jade.
          </p>

          <p>
            <span class="strength">He had great analytical abilities, a great kinesthetic sense, an ability to read emotions fairly well, a good spatial sense and a feel for music,</span> <span class="weakness">but he had a meager ability with social relationships and a little patience.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            He never became angry, <span class="trauma">after having a mandate ignored in 254.</span> He had little time for forgiveness and would generally seek retribution. He was often sad and dejected. He took no pleasure in his talents and appearance. He was somewhat quarrelsome, though he was conflicted by this for more than one reason. He was often nervous. He did not easily hate or develop negative feelings, <span class="trauma">after having to conduct an official meeting in a dining room in 252.</span> He tended to assume the worst of two outcomes would be the one that came to pass. He tended not to be swayed by emotional appeals. He occasionally overindulged, and he was troubled by this because he valued self-control. He preferred that everyone lived as harmoniously as possible. He tended to be a bit stubborn in changing his mind about things. He was trusting.
          </p>

					<p>
            <span class="quirk">When he was nervous, he tended to stretch his body. He bit his nails when he got bored.</span>
          </p>

					<p>
            He needed alcohol to get through the working day. He did not mind being outdoors, at least for a time. He didn't really care about anything anymore.
          </p>

          <p>
            Like others in his culture, he held craftsdwarfship to be of the highest ideals and celebrated talented artisans and their masterworks, greatly prized loyalty, valued family greatly, saw friendship as one of the finer things in life, believed that honesty was a high ideal, greatly respected artists and their works, really respected those that took the time to master a skill, deeply respected those that worked hard at their labors, respected fair-dealing and fair-play, valued cooperation, found merrymaking and partying worthwhile activities, valued martial prowess, valued leisure time and found nature somewhat disturbing. <span class="values">He personally found sacrifice to be one of the highest ideals</span> <span class="trauma">(due to being caught in the rain in 252),</span> <span class="values">was an absolute believer in the rule of law</span> <span class="trauma">(a strengthening after having to conduct an official meeting in a dining room in 252),</span> <span class="values">greatly respected those that observed decorum and maintained their dignity</span> <span class="trauma">(due to wearing old clothing in 256),</span> <span class="values">valued a harmonious existence</span>  <span class="trauma">(due to seeing the goblin Suque Ismanpim's dead body in 252),</span> <span class="values">valued self-control</span> <span class="trauma">(due to having a mandate ignored in 254),</span> <span class="values">found the pursuit of knowledge to be a waste of effort and didn't particularly respect commerce.</span> <span class="dream">He dreamt of raising a family.</span>

          <p>
            He liked pitchblende, steel, black zircon, the color emerald, battle axes, shields, buckets, llamas for their long necks, giant ticks for their ability to expand and the sound of the Rhyming Bewilderment. When possible, he preferred to consume giant cave toad, bat ray, cherry wine and hard wheat flour. He absolutely detests rats.
