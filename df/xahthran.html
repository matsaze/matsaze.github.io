          A goblin army from <span class="group" title="The Lies of Clinching">Smunstu Nûng</span> arrived in <span class="place" title="Thunderdoors">Amudtun</span> seeking a parley, on the <span class="bold">6th of Moonstone, 257</span>. The dwarven government of <span class="group" title="The Pink Gold">Othbemlimul</span> refused, sending forth the militia-dwarves of <span class="group" title="The Lean Blockade">Dalkammedtob</span>, as well as <span class="group" title="The Machines of Coal">Sâkud Rîsen</span>, the royal guard. Unbeknownst to <span class="group" title="The Pink Gold">Othbemlimul</span>, the militia-dwarves of <span class="group" title="The Lean Blockade">Dalkammedtob</span> were off-duty, and so the royal guards were sent ahead of them, vastly outnumbered by the invaders. By the time <span class="group" title="The Lean Blockade">Dalkammedtob</span> could assemble, all of the royal guard was wiped out: <span class="person">Mebzuth Rigòthhak</span>, <span class="person">Mûthkat Allasfath</span>, <span class="person">Aban Litastlist</span>, <span class="person">Nish Uthmikletmos</span> and <span class="person">Mörul Ralalåth</span>. Upon arrival, the militia-dwarves of <span class="group" title="The Lean Blockade">Dalkammedtob</span> bravely held off against the attackers, but they, too, were outnumbered. Soon afterwards, the recruits from <span class="group" title="The Diamond Mirrors">Dorenònul</span> were dispatched for reinforcement. The goblins were repelled, but at a great loss: <a class="person" href="dwarves/rakust-etestasob.html">Rakust Etestasob</a>, the <span class="group">Militia Commander of <span title="The Pink Gold">Othbemlimul</span></span> and two of his men, <span class="person">Zefon Ritanùshrir</span> and <span class="person">Doren Ösirnish</span>, died in battle. From the squad of <span class="group" title="The Diamond Mirrors">Dorenònul</span>, <span class="person">Mebzuth Rithedos</span>, <span class="person">Rith Edëmrifot</span>, <span class="person">Besmar Kelasol</span>, <span class="person">Mistêm Fikodbidnoz</span>, <span class="person">Minkot Rigòthtimnär</span> and <span class="person">Momuz Stukosidok</span> were struck down. Amidst the chaos, <span class="person">Endok Mafolthimshur</span> was found dead in the moat and <span class="person">Lorbam Otamoltar</span> was crushed under the draw bridge.
        </p>

				<p>
          <a class="person" href="dwarves/erith-eralmeng.html">Èrith Eralmeng Kilrudalis Tôsed</a> was assigned as the <span class="group">Militia Commander of <span title="The Pink Gold">Othbemlimul</span></span> following the death <a class="person" href="dwarves/rakust-etestasob.html">Rakust Etestasob</a>. For her bravery in combat, she was also bestowed the title of <span class="group">Champion of <span title="The Pink Gold">Othbemlimul</span></span>.

          On the <span class="bold">8th of Opal, 257</span>, <span class="person">Åblel Reglerom the Bard</span> withdrew from society in order to focus on the construction of a mysterious artifact. He went insane after failing to finish his craft, however. He was expelled from the city, but he stuck around the surrounding area until his eventual death.

        <p>

          <span class="person">Lorbam Dodóklerom the Militia Captain</span> was relieved of her post due to her injuries. <span class="person">Udib Enkoskonos the Bone Crafter</span> was assigned as captain of <span class="group" title="The Diamond Mirrors">Dorenònul</span> in her stead. <span class="person">Rith Lelumkol</span> was discharged from the squad as well. <span class="person">Sigun Godenthukkan</span> was recruited to fill in the ranks of the squad. Both <span class="person">Lorbam Dodóklerom</span> and <span class="person">Rith Lelumkol</span> spent the rest of their days at <span class="place" title="The Scholarly Sanctuary">Mishthemrovol</span> working as scholars.
